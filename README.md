# Todo_List_Javascript_Project

1. This todo list project is completely made with html, css, javascript alone.
2. The content of the page adjusts according to the width of the screen.
   2.1 The button text disappears and only icon remains if screen size is reduces to less than 40%.
   2.2 The content size and button size adjust automatically to reducing screen size.
3. I have setup various methods in java script to handel the possible cases of todo list tasks like adding, deleting, marking task done.
   3.1 Once you add a task -- it will show you toogle option, delete option.
   3.2 once you toogle a task it will change color and text will be marked.
   3.3 you can delete the task by clicking on delete icon.
